# Final Email

Upon finishing the video, one-pager and code requirements, all groups need to send a summary email to their external mentors.

This email should contain the following links and documents:

1. A link your final presentation. Generally it is okay to share via a good drive link. **However**, if you are working on an industry project or one with an NDA, please make sure that whatever sharing method you use targets the sharing to only the intended recipients. 
2. A copy of the final one pager (in pdf form).
3. A link to the github repository and code produced. You should also verify that the external mentors have access to the github repository. If they do not please contact the clinic director to update their access.

The email should also contain a short summary which:
1. Thanks the external mentors for their time during and before the quarter.
1. States that this is the final deliverable for this quarter and if there are any additional questions they should contact the clinic director directly.

The email should include the following parties:
1. All of the external mentors.
1. All of the students.
1. The internal mentor(s) and TA.
1. The clinic director and assistant clinic director (Nick Ross and Tim Hannifan).
