# Logistics 

This section contains information on important logistics and contact information for the clinic.

## Application Information
In order to enroll in the class, students must first submit an application and be matched with a project. The application requires a resume or CV, short statement of interest, and self-assessment of technical skills. Students are asked to rank their preferences for project placement.

Applications for Winter 2025 will open on November 21, 2024 at 2pm and will close on December 1, 2024 at 11:59pm. A link to the application will be posted here when the application opens.

## Information Session
An information session for Winter 2025 will be held on November 21, 2024 at 2pm on Zoom. During this session, clinic leadership will discuss the logistics of the class and upcoming projects for Winter 2025.

Register for the information session [here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEqcuqqrzoiE9LHKXPFVBl9JH_kF7_BUUUM).

## Project Information
Project descriptions for Winter 2025 will be released at the upcoming information session. 


## Meeting times / Simultaneous Enrollment

During the first week of clinic students are expected to meet at the time specified in the schedule, commonly TuTh 5-6:20, for orientation and introduction activities. 

During the first week, each project will identify meeting times specific to their project (two TA sessions and one mentor sessions). These meeting times are dependent on the TA, Mentor(s) and students schedule. These meeting times will be used for the rest of the quarter.

During the sixth week of the quarter there are a set of mid-quarter presentations. These presentations are not required for all team members -- though failing to support your team is a bad signal. The mid-quarter presentations are in-person and in the room scheduled for the class.

Since outside the times listed above we do not meet during the scheduled time it is not uncommon for students to enroll in a class with some overlap. If you do have a course which has some overlap or conflict with the scheduled time you may need to fill out a "Simultaneous Enrollment" form with your advisor. If this is the case please send an email to the clinic director stating that you will be doing this.

## In-person requirements

We expect all TA sessions and mentor meetings (unless the mentor chooses otherwise) to be done _in-person_ during normal business hours. If your schedule makes it difficult to be on the Hyde Park Campus during normal business hours, such as being in a program based down town or another commitment which takes you off campus for significant time then we recommend _not_ taking this course.

## People

The Data Science Clinic is administered by [Nick Ross](https://nickross.site) and [Tim Hannifan](https://github.com/timhannifan). Questions about the clinic should be addressed to them either over slack or via their UChicago email addresses.  

## Weekly Calendar

You can find a weekly calendar [here](./syllabus/weekly-plan.md). 

# Documents 

This section contains links to many of the important documents used in the clinic. 

## Syllabus

The Syllabus, including all course expectations can be found [here](./syllabus/syllabus.md).

## Progress and Planning Docs

Each week you are required to upload a planning and progress doc (due dates are specific to your project and can be found on Canvas). 

The planning doc can be found [here](./templates/planning-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a rubric [here](./rubrics/planning-doc-rubric.md).

The progress doc can be found [here](./templates/progress-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a rubric [here](./rubrics/progress-doc-rubric.md).

Note that in the `templates` directory you can also find MS-word versions of the two documents.

## First Week Org Report

The first week org report can also be found in the `templates` directory in a MS-WORD format. There is a markdown version [here](./templates/week-1-org-report.md). Grading for this is simple: if it is turned in on time and complete it receives full credit, otherwise zero.

## Meeting with External Mentors

Each time you meet with your external mentors you need to designate someone to be the note-taker. This person will write up the notes during the meeting making sure to include the information in the [mentor meeting template](./templates/mentor-meeting.md).

Mentor meeting notes needs to be committed to the repo in either a `docs` or `meetings` directory.

## Mid-quarter presentation

In week 6 of the clinic students will be required to complete a short mid-quarter presentation. There is a template for the presentation in the directory `templates`. 

If you want to receive an "A" on this assignment, _make sure to follow the [rubric](./rubrics/mid-quarter-presentation-rubric.md) precisely_.

# Finals Week Deliverables

As this is a projects based course most of the work is designed around a set of final deliverables. There are four set of requirements, each with their own rubric that you can find in the table below. These are to be completed during the last week of the quarter and finals week.

| Item | Requirement Information | Submission information and Rubric | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | You are required to turn in the code that you wrote in a well-kept repository and conforms to the [coding standards](./coding-standards/coding-standards.md) of the data science clinic. | For the final code submission you will need to fill out the worksheet [here](./templates/final-technical-submission.md) and submit that worksheet in Canvas. | 
| One pager | There is a one page project description that needs to be completed as part of the final submission. Note that you will be required to provide both a draft and final version. | Grading rubrics can be found [here](./rubrics/one-pager.md) and a template can be found [here](./templates/one-pager-template.docx). Both versions are to be submitted via Canvas. |
| Final Video | A short, recorded, video presentation is also required to be created. This includes two drafts and a final version. | Grading will be done according to the [rubric](./rubrics/final-video.md) and submission will be completed via Canvas. |
| Partner Email | Each team should designate one person to send a final email to the external partner with the video, one-pager and link to the code they developed. | Information on requirements for this email can be found [here](./rubrics/final-email.md). |

# FAQ

In this section you can find a list of frequently asked questions about the clinic.

### I am doing an internship/research experience/project in data science, can I waive out of the clinic? 

Unfortunately these classes are required for the major and there is no method of substituting them. Internships, Research experiences and projects come in all shapes and sizes and it isn't possible to guarantee any specific learning outcome, supervision or experience with them.

### As a Data Science Major, can I take the clinic over two non-consecutive quarters? 

It is strongly recommended to take the clinic in consecutive quarters. If you take it over non-consecutive quarters you will likely end up on two different projects which will significantly diminish the experience. At the individual level the most important learning experience occurs after you have internalized the domain and background of the project which frequently occurs in the second quarter.

### What are the prerequisites?

See the official course catalog [here](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/datascience/#datascienceclinic).

Prerequisites:

* DATA/CMSC 13600: Data Engineering
* DATA 12000: Computer Science for Data Science
* DATA 21100/21200: Mathematical Methods for Data Science I/II
* DATA 22100:  Introduction to Machine Learning
* Alternatively, by permission of the instructor.

### What if I miss the application deadline?

Apply next quarter. The Clinic runs during autumn, winter, and spring quarters.

### What if I can't attend the information session?

The information session will be recorded. Find recordings of past sessions [here](https://uchicago.box.com/s/35irwnktfazm8sjpdz82z8x6ssnimpcy).

### Does the Clinic qualify as an elective for my program?

Please consult with your academic advisor.

### Can I take Clinic twice in one quarter?

No. Students may only work on one project per quarter.

### Should I pre-register for the course?

No. Register for the course only when you've been matched with a project.

### How do I register once I've been admitted?

Undergraduates should add the class via my.uchicago. Graduate students need to contact their advisors to be added to the course manually.

### What if I'm missing a prerequisite?

For undergraduate students it is strongly recommended that students complete all prerequisites before enrolling in Clinic, but exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis. Priority in project placement is given to students that have completed all prerequisites. If you are an undergraduate data science major taking the clinic in your senior year and are still taking some of the prereqs during the year you will be admitted, but you may not receive your preferred project.

For graduate students applying to the data science clinic we do our best to evaluate each application to ensure that the applicant has sufficient experience to be successful in the curriculum. This evaluation occurs during the application process and the strongest indicator of application success is completion of multiple computer science courses. For graduate students, our minimum requirements are two quarters of Python based computer science classwork or equivalent work experience.  

### Who can I contact about the Data Science Clinic?

Inquiries can be sent to Nick Ross, Director of the Data Science Clinic.

### What if I have time conflicts with the scheduled time?

During the first week of clinic students are expected to meet at the time specified in the schedule, commonly TuTh 5-6:20, for orientation and introduction activities.

During the first week, each project will identify meeting times specific to their project (two TA sessions and one mentor sessions). These meeting times are dependent on the TA, Mentor(s) and students schedule. These meeting times will be used for the rest of the quarter.

During the sixth week of the quarter there are a set of mid-quarter presentations. These presentations are not required for all team members -- though failing to support your team is a bad signal. The mid-quarter presentations are in-person and in the room scheduled for the class.

Since outside the times listed above we do not meet during the scheduled time it is not uncommon for students to enroll in a class with some overlap. If you do have a course which has some overlap or conflict with the scheduled time you may need to fill out a "Simultaneous Enrollment" form with your advisor. If this is the case please send an email to the clinic director stating that you will be doing this.

### Is the Data Science Clinic a two quarter class?

Undergraduate Data Science majors are required to take two quarters of the Data Science Clinic to fulfill their graduation requirements. 

For students who are not Data Science majors, we strongly encourage planning to take the clinic for two quarters or more. Most of our projects have a steep learning curve before a student can contribute; participating for only a single quarter significantly limits the learning experience.

### When will I be notified of my placement?

Nearly all notification of placements occurs during the week after the applications are due. However the process takes some time and is usually not fully complete until the week before the quarter starts.

### Will I be notified if I am not placed?

Yes. Once placements are settled, all students not placed will be sent an notification via email.
