# Repo information

This repository contains information and documentation regarding the Data Science Clinic at the University of Chicago. 

This repository contains notes and documents regarding the coding standards expected by DSI projects.

All code produced should follow the requirements listed below. For questions and assistance on completing completing these requirements, please refer to the FAQ at the bottom of this page and the docs of this repository before reaching out to TAs and mentors. 

Our automated code test suite can be found in the [dsi-cocoa repo](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/cocoa).
 
## Welcome to the Clinic

This repository contains everything you need including grading rubrics, answers to common questions and templates for all assignments. 

### Weekly Calendar

You can find a weekly calendar [here](/syllabus/weekly-plan.md). 

### Syllabus

The Syllabus, including all course expectations can be found [here](/syllabus/syllabus.md).

### Progress and Planning Docs

Each week you are required to upload a planning and progress doc (due dates are specific to your project and can be found on Canvas). 

The planning doc can be found [here](/templates/planing-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a [rubric](/rubrics/planning-doc-rubric.md).

The progress doc can be found [here](/templates/progress-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a [rubric](/rubrics/progress-doc-rubric.md).

Note that in the directory `templates` directory you can also find MS-word versions of the two documents.

### First Week Org Report

The first week Org report can also be found in the `templates` directory in a MS-WORD format. There is a markdown version [here](/templates/week-1-org-report.md). Grading for this is simple: if it is turned in on time and complete it receives full credit, otherwise zero.

### Mid quarter presentation

In week 6 of the clinic students will be required to complete a short mid-quarter presentation. There is a template for the presentation in the directory `templates`. 

If you want to receive an "A" on this assignment, _make sure to follow the [rubric](/rubrics/mid-quarter-presentation-rubric.md) precisely_.

### Final Deliverables

There are three sets of final deliverables for each project:

##### Code 

At the end of the quarter you will need to turn over the code that you completed during the quarter. 

For the final code submission you will need to fill out the worksheet [here](/templates/final-technical-submission.md).

##### One Pager

There is a one pager that also needs to be completed as part of the final submission. One draft of the one pager is also required. Grading rubrics for both can be found [here](/rubrics/one-pager.md).

##### Final Video 

A short video presentation is also required. Two drafts and a final submission are to be completed according to the [rubric](/rubrics/final-video.md).
