# Logistics 

This section contains information on important logistics and contact information for the clinic.

## Meeting times / Simultaneous Enrollment

During the first week of clinic students are expected to meet at the time specified in the schedule, commonly TuTh 5-6:20, for orientation and introduction activities. 

During the first week, each project will identify meeting times specific to their project (two TA sessions and one mentor sessions). These meeting times are dependent on the TA, Mentor(s) and students schedule. These meeting times will be used for the rest of the quarter.

During the sixth week of the quarter there are a set of mid-quarter presentations. These presentations are not required for all team members -- though failing to support your team is a bad signal. The mid-quarter presentations are in-person and in the room scheduled for the class.

Since outside the times listed above we do not meet during the scheduled time it is not uncommon for students to enroll in a class with some overlap. If you do have a course which has some overlap or conflict with the scheduled time you may need to fill out a "Simultaneous Enrollment" form with your advisor. If this is the case please send an email to the clinic director stating that you will be doing this.

## In-person requirements

We expect all TA sessions and mentor meetings (unless the mentor chooses otherwise) to be done _in-person_ during normal business hours. If your schedule makes it difficult to be on the Hyde Park Campus during normal business hours, such as being in a program based down town or another commitment which takes you off campus for significant time then we recommend _not_ taking this course.

## People

The Data Science Clinic is administered by [Nick Ross](https://nickross.site) and [Tim Hannifan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hannifan/). Questions about the clinic should be addressed to them either over slack or via their UChicago email addresses.  

## Weekly Calendar

You can find a weekly calendar [here](./syllabus/weekly-plan.md). 

# Documents 

This section contains links to many of the important documents used in the clinic. 

## Syllabus

The Syllabus, including all course expectations can be found [here](./syllabus/syllabus.md).

## Progress and Planning Docs

Each week you are required to upload a planning and progress doc (due dates are specific to your project and can be found on Canvas). 

The planning doc can be found [here](./templates/planning-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a rubric [here](./rubrics/planning-doc-rubric.md).

The progress doc can be found [here](./templates/progress-doc.md) in markdown format. There is a rubric [here](./rubrics/progress-doc-rubric.md).

Note that in the `templates` directory you can also find MS-word versions of the two documents.

## First Week Org Report

The first week org report can also be found in the `templates` directory in a MS-WORD format. There is a markdown version [here](./templates/week-1-org-report.md). Grading for this is simple: if it is turned in on time and complete it receives full credit, otherwise zero.

## Mid-quarter presentation

In week 6 of the clinic students will be required to complete a short mid-quarter presentation. There is a template for the presentation in the directory `templates`. 

If you want to receive an "A" on this assignment, _make sure to follow the [rubric](./rubrics/mid-quarter-presentation-rubric.md) precisely_.

# Finals Week Deliverables

As this is a projects based course most of the work is designed around a set of final deliverables. There are four set of requirements, each with their own rubric that you can find in the table below. These are to be completed during the last week of the quarter and finals week.


| Item | Requirement Information | Submission information and Rubric | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | You are required to turn in the code that you wrote in a well-kept repository and conforms to the [coding standards](./coding-standards/coding-standards.md) of the data science clinic. | For the final code submission you will need to fill out the worksheet [here](./templates/final-technical-submission.md) and submit that worksheet in Canvas. | 
| One pager | There is a one page project description that needs to be completed as part of the final submission. Note that you will be required to provide both a draft and final version. | Grading rubrics can be found [here](./rubrics/one-pager.md) and a template can be found [here](./templates/one-pager-template.docx). Both versions are to be submitted via Canvas. |
| Final Video | A short, recorded, video presentation is also required to be created. This includes two drafts and a final version. | Grading will be done according to the [rubric](./rubrics/final-video.md) and submission will be completed via Canvas. |
| Partner Email | Each team should designate one person to send a final email to the external partner with the video, one-pager and link to the code they developed. | Information on requirements for this email can be found [here](./rubrics/final-email.md). |
