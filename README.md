# DSI Core Facility

This repository is for publicly sharing resources useful to the core facility. It should contain:
- Clear documentation of repeatable processes (using the DSI cluster, deploying a project on GCP, etc)
  - Incomplete documentation should stay in a pull request and be merged when completed
  - Documentation should be written a level a data science student would understand
- Links to useful resources (a great blog on Transformers, favorite tools for completing a task, etc) with any needed notes
It should not contain:
- Private information like passwords, private keys
- Original documentation where good documentation already exists
- Notes that are only discernable to you

Use this repository to be DRY. If you find yourself searching for the same blog post or writing up the same explanation to a clinic student multiple times, it is probably a good idea to save it somewhere you can quickly find it again. As this repo grows (or doesn't) it will be more clear how to best organize it.
