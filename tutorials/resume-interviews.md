# How to write and talk about your project

This document contains the general rules and themes around what you are and not allowed to communicate on a resume and in an interview about a previous job or project.

This should be considered _guidance_ and a framework for thinking about what you can and cannot say about a project. Every project is different, and it is important to think through what you want to disclose.

There are three sections in this document:

1. [What is always allowed to be disclosed](#what-is-always-allowed-to-be-disclosed)
2. [What should _never_ be disclosed](#what-should-never-be-disclosed)
3. [The gray area and how to navigate it](#the-gray-area)

### What is always allowed to be disclosed

Basic information and logistics of the project are always allowed to disclose:
* How you worked, when you met, team size, etc.
* Basic information about who you worked with at the company, such as their title.
* Tools you used (Python, what libraries, etc.)
* Anything public about the organization
* What you would find on their website, etc.
* Publicly available code, documents and PR related activities.

Note that _some_ project are 100\% public. In this case you are allowed to show and share the code. If the code is _not_ public, code should neither be shared nor used in any context.

### What should never be disclosed

Non publicly available code, code snippets, files and documents.
Detailed model results or information that could be used to directly reproduce your analysis or results.

### The gray area

The gray area includes things are almost always allowed to be disclosed, but when you do you need to be careful not to stray too far afield.

> **_IMPORTANT:_** The “Gray Area” guidelines here are just that – guidelines. If you have specific questions around an aspect of the below, please reach out.

The problem statement:
* What were you working on?
* Why was it important to the company? (Motivation)
* The basic setup of the problem
* General descriptions of the information available, such as the form (images or text) and rounded numbers of items or elements. 
    * Detailed descriptions of the data are to be avoided. 
    * If the information is a paid-for or commonly used source, then it is usually okay to mention the sources name (“Bloomberg terminal.”)
* The techniques that you used, especially if they are readily available in a pre-built python or R package.
* General discussion of model assessment, specifically if those assessments are standard packages. (“Evaluated via F1 because…”)

Results:

* Information on process improvements:
    * “We increased speed by 10x” or “Our model performance beat the current model by 2%”
    * Accuracy and specific benchmarks should be avoided as they get darker in the gray area.
* Anything that is “obvious” from what the company does.
    * One way of thinking about obvious is asking yourself “Would I be surprised if a company didn’t do this?” 
    * If the answer is “Yes” then it is probably all right to disclose.


### Conclusion

Keep in mind that the above are general guidelines. If you have any specific questions reach out to the director of the data science clinic.
