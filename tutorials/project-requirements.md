#TODO/WIP
For new projects, we want to make sure we meet some minimum requirements before handing off to students. We also want to make the process of creating project briefs easier. 

Here are minimum requirements for a new project:

- Repo location
- Datasets
    - Include a link to the dataset (in our Google Drive if we are hosting or weblink if it's publicly available)
    - Include a brief description of the dataset
- External Contact Names
    - Include the name, contact information, and role for our primary contact(s) with our partner organizations
- Tools Required
    - Include a list of the programming languages and packages that you expect to be used during the project
- Project Brief Example
    
    Here's an example project brief that can be used as a template: TODO
