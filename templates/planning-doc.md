This report can be filled out using the [Microsoft Word Template](./planning-doc.docx). Submit the document in pdf format via Canvas by the assigned date and time.

## Requirements 
A completed template submitted to Canvas by the required date and time.

## Logistics and Timing

Tasks should be assigned to a single individual. If the same task is repeated multiple times, the task should be broken up into smaller individual tasks each assigned to a single person,

Mentors may apply additional grading standards to the rubrics below.
