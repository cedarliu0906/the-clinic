# Mentor Meeting Template

This template represents the minimum information that needs to be collected each time you meet with your external mentors.

Each time you meet with your external mentors, please fill out the following information and commit it to the repo in either a `docs` or `meetings` directory. The document should be saved as either a markdown (`.md`), text (`.txt`) or MS-word (`.docx`) file.

Failure to complete this will result in points taken off for _all_ members of the team, so work together to get it done!

### Meeting information
- Time and place of the meeting (note if on zoom)
- A list of all attendees (including those from UChicago)
  
### Meeting Notes
- Please write down a complete set of notes for the meeting. 
  - In terms of detail and length the expectation is that there should be nearly one page per half hour of meeting. So an hour long meeting would be around two pages.
  - Include a set of action items that came out of the meeting. What specific things need to be done (and by whom)? This should be a separate, identifiable section of the meeting notes.
