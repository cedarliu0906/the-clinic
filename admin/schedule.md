All â€“ Part of the grade of the clinic is a technical assessment of your code. You can find more information in the links below, including a grading rubric.
If you want to receive full credit your code needs to follow the conventions outlined in the rubric. In this thread we started running COCOA (w/o the lint option, make sure to turn that on for your final grade) to give you a sense of some of the work that needs to be completed.
As you start into the last two weeks of the quarter, please make sure that you add time to apply the changes expected.
Package to evaluate code: https://github.com/dsi-clinic/cocoa
Coding standards documentation: https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/coding-standards/coding-standards.md
Grading Rubric: https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/rubrics/final-technical-cleanup.md

Hello TAs, today at 5pm is the cutoff for students to submit code. After the deadline, you should start the technical review process for the two repos that you are assigned. The details of the repo assignments and links can be found here.
For each repo you are assigned, you should:
- identify three random python files or notebooks that have been touched this quarter
- create a md file for each repository and complete this checklist for each file: https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/rubrics/final-technical-cleanup.md
- run `cocoa <dir> --lint --date 2024-03-18` on the cloned repo and copy/paste the output into a md file
By Friday at 5pm, you should return to me two md files for each repository you've been assigned. Thank you for your help!
```
