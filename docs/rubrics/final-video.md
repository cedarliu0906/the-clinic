# Final Video Presentation Grading Rubric

This document outlines the requirements for the final video presentation for the Data Science Clinic at the University of Chicago. 

The audience of this presentation is your peers. They are smart and knowledgeable about data science but are by no means experts in the field. The aim of this communication exercise is to create a record of what you did that is accessible, interesting and provides a high-level overview and summary of your work. It isn’t supposed to be complete or provide enough detail on how to replicate your work. 

The following presentations are high quality examples from previous years. This should give you a sense of the level of effort that is expected (Note that some of the requirements have changed from previous years, so these would not be considered “A+” under this year’s rubric).

## Requirements 

* The video presentation should be between 8-12 minutes in length.
* The video must be uploaded to Canvas. No links to YouTube, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. 
    * Canvas submissions are limited to < 75MB. Reduce the quality of the video to reduce the file size. Leave time to upload to Canvas before the deadline. Failing to meet the deadline or not uploading due to file size problems will negatively impact your grade.
* The presentation needs to convey: 
    * The purpose and importance of the project. 
    * The contribution that you made.
    * The results you have completed.


## Logistics and Timing 
There are two draft videos due before the final video. All video submission dates and times can be found on Canvas. For each draft video, you will receive feedback from your project mentor on what improvements or changes should be made. Those changes should be implemented before submitting the next version.

## Grading 
Your group will receive a separate grade for each draft and the final video. Each team member will receive the same grade. You will be graded on the following factors:
* Slide quality
    * Do the slides use correct grammar, consistent formatting/style, and are they easy to read?
    * Are the slides too busy?
    * Are plots/graphs labeled correctly and easy to read?
* Presentation quality
    * Does the presentation achieve the goals above (introducing the problem, your contribution and your results)?
    * Did the presenters speak loudly, slowly and clearly?
    * Are the speakers bringing energy? 
* Organization
    * Is the presentation well-organized?
    * Does it follow an obvious pattern that the audience can follow?

Draft videos should demonstrate a significant level of effort. Each draft should satisfy the requirements listed above and avoid any placeholder slides/graphs/tables. The second and final drafts will be graded on if you responded to the feedback from your mentor.

<u>First Draft Video (30 Points)</u>
* 15 Points: Presentation
* 5 Points: Organization
* 10 Points: Slides

<u>Second Draft Video (40 Points)</u>
* 15 Points: Presentation
* 5 Points: Organization
* 10 Points: Slides
8 10 Points: Updates, changes and issue correction based on feedback

<u>Final Video (60 Points)</u>
* 20 Points: Presentation
* 10 Points: Organization
* 20 Points: Slides
* 10 Points: Updates, changes and issue correction based on feedback

### Dos and Don'ts 
* Do not speed up / slow down the presentation using software tools
* Use a microphone. The presentation audio needs to be well recorded. There should be no background noise, difficult to understand speakers, audio that goes in and out, etc.
* Avoid using terms which are specific to your project or technical jargon.
* The presentation should not contain screenshots of Jupyter Notebooks or other code. 
Do not attempt to teach advanced concepts. If a core part of your project is a novel or unfamiliar concept then you should explain, but at a high level. 
* Make sure to spend time framing the problem, describing why it’s important and how what you are doing links to it.
* Every project has interesting and unexpected aspects – you want to highlight those. Are there any cool visualizations? What about results?
* Do not violate any NDA/share any special sauce.
* Do not read lists of numbers from the slides.
* Specific descriptions of technology tend to be boring. It’s okay to have a system diagram if the project has a large engineering component.
* No meta-editorializing like “Hmmm.. Let's fix this next time” or “ummm… I think we should change the order of the slides in the next draft”. Each video should be treated as a final version.

### Late Policy
Assignments submitted after the due date will receive a grade of zero.


### F.A.Q.



| Does everyone need to speak?      | 
| ----------- | 
| No. We strongly encourage everyone to participate and present at least a part of the final presentation, but we will not be assessing individual contributions. | 




| How should we record the presentation? | 
| ----------- | 
| Zoom, Canva (and even Microsoft PowerPoint) provide tools to be able to create a high-quality video. From our experience, Zoom has consistently been the easiest for groups to use, so that is our default recommendation. |


| What if my presentation video isn’t uploading to Canvas? | 
| ----------- | 
| If you are struggling to upload your presentation, there are a few solutions that we have found to work:
* Make the video smaller (you can google different techniques for this depending on if you are on Mac or Windows).
* You can try to zip your video.
* Make sure that you are on a high-quality internet connection.
* Try a different group member's computer. |
