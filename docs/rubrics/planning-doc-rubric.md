# Planning Document Grading Rubric

The planning document should outline each team member's assigned tasks for the next week.

## Requirements 
A completed template submitted to Canvas by the required date and time.

## Logistics and Timing 
The report deadlines are based on the day of the mentor meeting. The planning report is due at midnight on the day of the mentor meeting.

## Grading 
Grades are assigned on a scale of 0-5 points and each student in the group may receive a different grade. 

Tasks should be assigned to a single individual. If the same task is repeated multiple times, the task should be broken up into smaller individual tasks each assigned to a single person,

Mentors may apply additional grading standards to the rubrics below.
