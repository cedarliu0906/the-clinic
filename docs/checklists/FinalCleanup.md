### Final Cleanup and Technical Review

The purpose of this document is to describe the final code clean up steps to be completed at the end of a data science institute project. This checklist should be considered a set of requirements and while it is possible that some of the items below should not be done, there should be a significant and obvious reason why they are not completed.

These steps are presented in checklist form for ease of evaluation. 

- [ ] Does the code repository conform to all standards laid out in the Code Repository Standards document](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/coding-standards#requirements] in this repo?
- [ ] Have all work product been put into a single branch (generally `main`)?
- [ ] Have all, non-main, branches that were created during this project been deleted?
- [ ] Have all contributors added their names to the appropriate README?
- [ ] Is/are there README file(s) which contain information on how to run the code in the repo, where the data came from and links to all outside information?
- [ ] Is all documentation in markdown format? Are there grammar/syntax/formatting issues which impede comprehension?
